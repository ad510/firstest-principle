- based on Scott Aaronson's reply, he seems to think this is a valid experiment, but if you can be uploaded to classical computer then outcome only matters to you not everyone
- i.e. he seems to put experiments in 3 categories: experiments, experiments but only for some people, not experiments
- I had somehow convinced myself previously that all experiments are actually in the "experiments but only for some people" category, but not for any reason that I could explain effectively
  - what does he mean by "operational meaning" and "universal validity"
- I mainly disagree with him on this on a philosophical/ethical standpoint and not an empirical or logical one, so it'll be hard to show that either of these positions is objectively wrong. But I think almost everyone is going to agree with my position by the time we actually develop mind uploading technologies.
  - consumers will hold physicists accountable for being able to predict what they'll perceive, whether physicists think they should be responsible for that or not

Also, assuming a positive cosmological constant, sufficiently far parts of the universe would be forever out of causal contact with us—leading to philosophical debate about whether those parts should figure into scientific explanations, or even be considered to “exist.” (64)

- our perspective: person in sim's claims don't have universal validity
- sim perspective: person outside's theory doesn't explain my situation, but it has universal validity?
  - not if person in sim's experiences can be solely (not partially) determined by simulation splits, but not clear that's possible due to cosmic rays and other random events

- more to it than that, since I thought probability of body you wake up in tomorrow is also scientific question
- does "universal validity" apply to measurement or hypothesis
  - if hypothesis then our current physics theories wouldn't have universal validity
  - if measurement then nonzero probability that it'll be reversed by quantum fluctuations (can I think of something better than that?)
- what definition of "universal validity" would imply that physical measurements have universal validity, but measuring result of simulation split doesn't
  - measurement => you don't know outcome before measuring, but you do after measuring
  - everyone would measure the same outcome
    - who is everyone? if includes people outside cosmological horizon or all branches of many-worlds then physical measurements aren't UV
    - everyone = everyone you can communicate to
      - naively this includes invisible ghosts listening to us but who are selectively deaf when we tell them about measurement outcomes (then those physical measurements aren't UV), need more specific definition to clarify ghosts don't exist
    - everyone = everyone who can communicate to you
      - if there are aliens who were inside our cosmologial horizon in the past but not anymore, then physical measurements aren't UV
      - if people have free will, then this includes invisible, deaf ghosts who know about you but choose not to communicate with you, if they exist then physical measurements aren't UV
    - everyone = everyone who you've communicated with (in both directions) in the past and you can still communicate with (in both directions), assuming people have free will
      - (doesn't work if other people don't have free will b/c if you go in sim and no one outside communicates with you afterward, then measuring simulation split has UV)
      - works with cosmological horizon b/c you can no longer communicate with those aliens
      - works when you put yourself in sim b/c simulation split is a measurement to you but not to people outside
        - if your experiences in sim can be solely (not partially) determined by simulation splits then people outside can no longer communicate to you, but not clear that's possible due to cosmic rays and other random events
      - works when we don't know whether our universe is simulation b/c if there's people in outer universe, they haven't communicated to us
      - I think this actually works! this still allows humanlike AI characters to have a different TOE than us, but no longer allows you to travel between different "universes" with different TOEs like in scientific question1.2, which would be ridiculous
        - unless you forget about the people you communicated with in the past (hee hee hee)
- I still want to follow up on corpus collosum question
  - he could just say that isn't universally valid either, but I could reply that would be giving up on science
