The branch of Plausible Deniability in which my stupid, untrustworthy intuition proceeds to [fool itself](https://www.lhup.edu/~DSIMANEK/cargocul.htm) with [not-even-wrong](http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Not_even_wrong) wild physics speculations.

I'm writing these notes to remind myself about what I've been thinking about rather than to make any sort of sense, so these notes will probably look like gibberish to anyone but me. If you insist on reading them anyway, writeup.txt is probably the best place to start.

WTF is my intuition thinking?
-----------------------------

There's a mapping between [Feynman diagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feynman_diagram) and [RTS games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_strategy), so a lot of tricks that nature plays on us in quantum mechanics can also be done by players in RTS games. Plausible Deniability exploits this, and I found that a lot of these tricks that sound weird and arbitrary in the context of particle physics suddenly make a lot of sense when used in RTS games. In the past, looking at existing physics theories in a different way often led to new discoveries. So my stupid intuition somehow fooled itself into thinking that it [understands quantum mechanics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZRLllWgHI) (which it doesn't) and it's now proceeding on a wild goose chase to find the theory of quantum gravity. The logical part of me thinks it is being stupid, but my intuition couldn't resist and these notes are its outlet.
