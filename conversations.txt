matthew next topics 2015-12-13:
- firstest principle isn't original (it's actually kind of obvious once you know what it means), what I haven't seen before is how I think it can be used in science
- whether consciousness works that way is also example of experiment, not just an assumption I'm making

matthew 2015-11-27:
- compare to being blindfolded and taken to numbered room (don't know how it's picked), number is revealed gradually
- if identical people taken to every room and you're one of them, wouldn't that make all rooms same probability?
- no and I suspect reason why has to do with identical people, how does that affect algorithmic probability?
- he prefers wording of "consciousnesses with identical past memories" (you can't tell which one you are) over "your identity over time"
- roadmap of topics helps
- use learning algorithm to guess subjective probabilities when underlying process generating probabilities is unknown
- algorithmic probability motivation is less random bit strings seem more likely
- clearly distinguish input, program, console output bit strings
- describe how it is learning algorithm before explaining why it converges

zucchinize 2015-10-05:
- pointed out how many assumptions I made to get to point of putting person in computer (which I already knew, but worth emphasizing)

zach 2015-08-11:
- Being one of the consciences in one of the realities, is it scientific to ask the probability that coin flip will be heads or tails?

matthew 2015-05-12:
- mention running lottery twice?
- Matthew didn't get how if someone can't distinguish possibilities, can really mess with them

zach 2014-12-20:
- given any TOE we can make VR sim that does something else
- die when 1st computer blows up -> can tell which computer you're in -> scientific question
- more assumptions
  - there's a TOE
  - there *is* enough energy in universe to make these sims
