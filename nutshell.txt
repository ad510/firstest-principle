in a nutshell (if I'm not fooling myself):
idea      = formula = type    = space     = ... (if the concepts are generalized sufficiently)
execution = proof   = program = spacetime = ...
In theory, a prior probability distribution of programs is that of fair coin flips.
In practice, we just use our brains.

additionally:
- experiment that Solomonoff induction answers that quantum mechanics & general relativity don't: see writeup
- more equivalences: see nutshell more
- evaluating Solomonoff induction as theory of everything: https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0011122 and https://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Ozkural_E/0/1/0/all/0/1
  - I independently wrote "wow, is that really TOE?" in speculation6 2015-02-04 but these guys analyzed it more rigorously
- perceived time = entropy = (approximately) length of program
- perceived distance (between 2 types) = expected length of program (distributed using algorithmic probability) that transforms values from one type to another

more speculative ideas:
- I suspect speculation6 & speculation4 are onto something, though when I wrote "entropy reduction" I likely was thinking of entanglement
- perceived time translation: see speculation14
- copying self: see speculation15
- matter antimatter imbalance: see speculation16
- gravity = sum of infinitely many fundamental forces
  - might want to model with superset of general relativity that doesn't obey equivalence principle in the general case
