in a nutshell (if I'm not fooling myself):
- theory of everything is algorithmic probability
- how to interpret it
  - time = entropy reduction = copying stuff (specifically making lambda calculus terms of the same type) = measurement = how much you remember = lifetime
    - might need to remove log scale when defining time in terms of entropy reduction
    - substitute entropy with "shit" and all the connotations work
  - space = entropy reducer = stuff (lambda calculus types) that is copied = what you measure = memories = life
- you want to maximize time you perceive in your lifetime
  - lots of goodies in speculation4 & speculation6, read speculation6 first
- 2 steps to living
  1. pick something that's good at making copies of stuff (esp. itself)
  2. turn random stuff into copies of that
  - biology: 1 = don't get sick, 2 = reproduce
  - business: 1 = idea, 2 = execution
  - products: 1 = design, 2 = manufacturing
  - software: 1 = programming, 2 = distribution
  - cpu: 1 = caching algorithm, 2 = act of caching
    - I find it so fascinating that key to making computers fast is making copies of data (i.e. caching) rather than anything else
  - generally right brain good at 1, left brain good at 2
