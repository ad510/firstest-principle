in a nutshell (if I'm not fooling myself):
- theory of everything is that probability distribution of programs is that of fair coin flips on input tape
  - you will make the same predictions no matter which programming language you use (see algorithmic probability)
- experiment it answers that quantum mechanics & general relativity don't: see scientific question1-2
- how to interpret it
  - space = type = formula = idea
  - spacetime = program = proof = execution
  - time = length of program = entropy
  - distance (between 2 types) = length of shortest program that transforms values from one type to another
  - "shit" that people (especially startup founders & CEOs) deal with is a valid form of energy
    - I don't yet know how this relates to space or time
- I suspect speculation6 & speculation4 are onto something, but they're wrong/incomplete in a few key ways that I don't fully understand yet
- gravity = sum of infinitely many fundamental forces (kind of unrelated, but whatever)
  - might want to model with superset of general relativity that doesn't obey equivalence principle
