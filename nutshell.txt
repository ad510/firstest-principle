in a nutshell (if I'm not fooling myself):
idea      = formula = type    = space     = ... (if the concepts are generalized sufficiently)
execution = proof   = program = spacetime = ...
In theory, a prior probability distribution of programs is that of fair coin flips.
In practice, we just use our brains.

additionally:
- experiment that Solomonoff induction answers that quantum mechanics & general relativity don't: see scientific question1.1
- more equivalences: see nutshell more
- perceived time = entropy = (approximately) length of program
- perceived distance (between 2 types) = expected length of program (distributed using algorithmic probability) that transforms values from one type to another

more speculative ideas:
- I suspect speculation6 & speculation4 are onto something, though when I wrote "entropy reduction" I likely meant something else
- energy: see speculation11
- gravity = sum of infinitely many fundamental forces
  - might want to model with superset of general relativity that doesn't obey equivalence principle in the general case
