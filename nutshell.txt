in a nutshell (if I'm not fooling myself):
- theory of everything is Solomonoff induction
- experiment it answers that quantum mechanics & general relativity don't: see scientific question1.1
- how to interpret it
  - space     = type    = formula = idea      = ... (if the concepts are generalized sufficiently)
  - spacetime = program = proof   = execution = ...
  - time = entropy = (approximately) length of program
  - distance (between 2 types) = expected length of program (distributed using algorithmic probability) that transforms values from one type to another

more speculative ideas:
- I suspect speculation6 & speculation4 are onto something, but they're wrong/incomplete in a few key ways that I don't fully understand yet
- gravity = sum of infinitely many fundamental forces (kind of unrelated, but whatever)
  - might want to model with superset of general relativity that doesn't obey equivalence principle
