Time translation on mixed states

Non working ideas:
- state = output bitstring
- mixed state = probability distribution of output bitstrings
- time(state B) = expected length of programs that output bitstring beginning with B
- time_translation(state B, delta time T) = set containing every state B1 where
  - B1 begins with B
  - time(B1) >= time(B) + T
  # returning set of bitstrings is sufficient to get its probability distribution (using algorithmic probability)
- time_translation(mixed state S, delta time T) = 

Time is discrete when we measure 1 bit at a time (speculation13), so we need a continuous model if we want continuous time translation
  Worth it if it lets me figure out what energy is
State = number between 0 and 1
  When written in binary, corresponding (infinite) output bitstring is digits after the decimal point
Mixed state = probability density function of a state
  Damn, is this still discrete? E.g. All 0s can be printed by finite program
  Maybe this actually isn't PDF but can be combined with algorithmic probability to get actual probability distribution

Working idea (I think):
We actually want to turn a prior probability distribution into another prior probability distribution
After a time interval, for each possible bitstring we expect to have measured a certain number of bits. So chop off those bits and return the same probability but for the remaining bits.
  If expect to have measured more bits than length of bitstring, then ignore that bitstring. This is ok because this is output bitstring (not program bitstring) and 1 bit at a time Solomonoff induction has similar behavior.
This helps analyze different paths to the same state
  If a bunch of "random gobbledygook" happens then a lot of time passes but afterward you don't think so (speculation6 virtual particles)
  But if you gradually turn into random gobbledygook then reverse time operator actually loses information
  Related to forgetting = put big distance between stuff
  Perceived lifetime = when you run time operator in reverse, how much time do you think passed
I should define "reverse time operator" more precisely
  In statistical physics, entropy = known unknown = info stored in environment (not in system)
  Can do Solomonoff induction in reverse by reversing long bitstring and predicting next bits. So reverse time translation likely possible too.
