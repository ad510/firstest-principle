in a nutshell (if I'm not fooling myself):
- theory of everything is algorithmic probability
- what it answers that QM & GR don't: see scientific question1-2
- how to interpret it
  - time = entropy reduction = copying stuff = how much you measure = how much you remember = lifetime
    - might need to remove log scale when defining time in terms of entropy reduction
    - substitute entropy with "shit" and all the connotations work
  - space = entropy reducer = stuff that is copied = measurements = memories = life
- you want to maximize time you perceive in your lifetime
  - lots of goodies in speculation4 & speculation6, read speculation6 first
- 2 steps to living
  1. pick something that's good at making copies of stuff (esp. itself)
  2. turn random stuff into copies of that
  - biology: 1 = have good genes, 2 = reproduce
  - business: 1 = idea, 2 = execution
  - products: 1 = design, 2 = manufacturing
  - math: 1 = statement, 2 = proof
  - type theory: 1 = type, 2 = program
  - computers: 1 = functions (on values), 2 = i/o (on places)
  - cpu: 1 = caching algorithm, 2 = act of caching
    - I find it so fascinating that key to making computers fast is making copies of data (i.e. caching) rather than anything else
  - social: 1 = thought, 2 = communication
  - hiring: 1 = smart, 2 = gets stuff done
  - generally right brain good at 1, left brain good at 2
- gravity = sum of infinitely many fundamental forces (kind of unrelated, but whatever)
  - might want to model with superset of general relativity that doesn't obey equivalence principle
