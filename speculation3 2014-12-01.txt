- (wild speculation warning)
- time and space are whatever we think they are
- time = amount that you remember between 2 different states
- distance = time that it would take to go to a different state (i.e. become something else), if for whatever reason that is the "right thing" to do
  - note that different state includes (memory of) how you get there
  - corresponds to colloquial use of "close" and "far away"
  - Feynman diagrams rotated any way would still be valid, but space and time axes are what they are for a reason
