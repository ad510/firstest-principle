Ask if consistent histories branch structure is only of observable universe
If yes, can finding center be used to reconstruct where (who) you are (scientific question3)
If no, could be infinitely many observable universes similar to ours and we wouldn't have a way to know which one is ours (even probabilistically), so how could you still make probabilistic predictions when you don't know which of them is the one you're in

Quantum state of you:
Countable list of observables, you check off as you observe them
Use Solomonoff induction to predict what you observe next for finite amount of time
