Note to self: standard model fields are amplitudes for finding particle of each type at each point

How do you experimentally determine partition between you and not you? By definition you cannot experimentally determine what quantum state of not you is (but you can measure it by becoming entangled with it) and no one else can experimentally determine partition of you and not you

If you try to predict, run into free will question that quantum doesn't answer

If you are every particle in brain, entangles too strongly with both computers

Footnotes:
/ In theoretical computer science, a computer is a universal Turing machine with unlimited memory and time to do calculations, but that cannot solve the halting problem. Everywhere else, a computer is an actual, physical machine that does calculations in real time and can run out of disk space and I don't care what "Turing degree" it has. When physicists informally say "we might be living in a computer simulation," they rarely make this distinction clear, which can easily cause confusion. Also, it's possible to study physics from an information theory perspective without assuming that the universe is fundamentally the output of a Turing machine.

Why not define you to include future? While you can indeed define you this way, at fundamental level we don't know what our future behavior will be. Defining you this way does not solve this underlying problem but scientific method does

Why does it matter which one is the real you if they are both you? You see both isn't an option, one version of you sees 0, another version sees 1, which version are you

Technically not an algorithm

Doesn't matter which language

Algorithmic probability usually described in terms of Turing machines, there are many potential meanings and I give a different variation than the one in the link (checked with someone), important part is it converges

If those Wikipedia articles make your head explode (don't worry, they do that to me too), here's a somewhat more accessible introduction to the [problems harder than halting problem].
