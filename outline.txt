To the best of my understanding, you have to...
Decoherence math techniques might help here (I am confused by their math), but this question is so sensitive to who "you" are that I don't know whether they would be enough
  Seem like workarounds rather than solutions to the underlying problem
If you know of a way to predict this with standard model, please email me
  Remove confident sounding conclusion

Note to self: standard model fields are amplitudes for finding particle of each type at each point

How do you experimentally determine partition between you and not you? By definition you cannot experimentally determine what quantum state of not you is (but you can measure it by becoming entangled with it) and no one else can experimentally determine partition of you and not you

If you try to predict, run into free will question that quantum doesn't answer

Alternate footnote: according to Scott A, it is an unsolved problem whether you are made out of classical or quantum information. But if you are made out of classical information, that would mean you can't even model you as a quantum state and the [no cloning theorem] would not prevent making unlimited [copies of you inside different simulations](mind uploading). In that case we'd definitely need a new physics theory to predict which simulation you'd find yourself in! Perhaps I should check with him if that is really what he meant...
Check: can classical information be made out of quantum bits?

One thing about a question like "who are you" is that the answer is different for everyone, and if "you" are a quantum state entangled with the larger quantum state of the universe, standard model doesn't give you a way to figure out which parts of the quantum state of the universe are "you" vs "not you". This is a real issue when you want to try to answer questions like these (wait but why). Some proposed theories of everything like digital physics are a lot less sensitive to how you answer this question, which is why I think they are promising.

Footnotes:
/ In theoretical computer science, a computer is a universal Turing machine with unlimited memory and time to do calculations, but that cannot solve the halting problem. Everywhere else, a computer is an actual, physical machine that does calculations in real time and can run out of disk space and I don't care what "Turing degree" it has. When physicists informally say "we might be living in a computer simulation," they rarely make this distinction clear, which can easily cause confusion. Also, it's possible to study physics from an information theory perspective without assuming that the universe is fundamentally the output of a Turing machine.

Why not define you to include future? While you can indeed define you this way, at fundamental level we don't know what our future behavior will be. Defining you this way does not solve this underlying problem but scientific method does

Why does it matter which one is the real you if they are both you? You see both isn't an option, one version of you sees 0, another version sees 1, which version are you

Technically not an algorithm

Doesn't matter which language

Algorithmic probability usually described in terms of Turing machines, there are many potential meanings and I give a different variation than the one in the link (checked with someone), important part is it converges

If those Wikipedia articles make your head explode (don't worry, they do that to me too), here's a somewhat more accessible introduction to the [problems harder than halting problem].
