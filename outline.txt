Who proposes as toe? that guy, Max T, anyone mainstream?
Elon musk suggests live in sim but not learning algorithms

Proposing learning algorithms as toe used to be something that only cocky eyed people like Max T would do, but it seems to be starting to enter mainstream (?) I hope you learned something interesting from reading this, and if you happen to be a physicist who heard about this before but couldn't understand why anyone would study it, I hope this cleared up any confusions you may have had.

Footnotes:
In theoretical computer science, a computer is a universal Turing machine with unlimited memory and time to do calculations, but that cannot solve the halting problem. Everywhere else, a computer is an actual, physical machine that does calculations in real time and can run out of disk space and I don't care what "Turing degree" it has. When physicists informally say "we might be living in a computer simulation," they rarely make this distinction clear, which can easily cause confusion. Also, it's possible to study physics from an information theory perspective without assuming that the universe is fundamentally the output of a Turing machine.

Ask AI to make brain computer interface

Why not define you to include future? While you can indeed define you this way, at fundamental level we don't know what our future behavior will be. Defining you this way does not solve this underlying problem but scientific method does

Why does it matter which one is the real you if they are both you? You see both isn't an option, one version of you sees 0, another version sees 1, which version are you

Technically not an algorithm

Doesn't matter which language

Algorithmic probability usually described in terms of Turing machines, there are many potential meanings and I give a different variation than the one in the link (checked with someone), important part is it converges
