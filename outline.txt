Who proposes as toe? that guy, Max T, anyone mainstream?
Elon musk suggests live in sim but not learning algorithms

Proposing learning algorithms as toe used to be something that only cocky eyed people like Max T would do, but it seems to be starting to enter mainstream (?) I hope you learned something interesting from reading this, and if you happen to be a physicist who heard about this before but couldn't understand why anyone would study it, I hope this cleared up any confusions you may have had.
