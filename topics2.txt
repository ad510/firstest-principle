- living in sim experiment, solomonoff induction
- evaluating solomonoff induction as a TOE (later parts of answer1.1)
- more applications of solomonoff induction (brain splitting, measurement in quantum mechanics)
- time perception when living in a sim
  - end with if entropy def of time behaves anything like QM then it should be possible to derive energy operator & conservation of energy, but my math skills are too bad to do this
- physical interpretation of types
- my firstest principle
- how we intuitively do physics
  - I think we all do this, I just wish I understood what instant gratification monkeys tell me
- plausible deniability
- tech singularity
