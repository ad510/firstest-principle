- Curry-Howard correspondence: generally proof=program, formula=type
- what you're making copies of is instances of types?
- try again to look for mapping btwn Feynman diagrams & programs?
  - Feynman diagram ops are split & merge, lambda calculus ops are make function & call function (but sometimes need parentheses)
  - but can't be that simple b/c make function takes variable & expression while call function takes 2 expressions, and Feynman diagrams include space & time

- relational programming incorporates running programs in reverse: https://igor.io/2014/08/06/reasoned-php.html
